My course project made for VR systems!

Requirements: Any usage of WinAPI/Windows core interactions

Accomplished by adding the sndPlaySound function from winmm.dll

This project helped me to accomplish those goals:

- Create a project that would be played on any VR system (with a little exception, which is usage of winapi functions. Those would work only on Windows OS)
- Create a simple AI for the enemies to move around
- Create an enemy-generating system
- Create a shooting mechanics & successfully create a system of interactions between rigidbodies
- Do it all in two days

Those project goals were planned, but NOT accomplished:

- Well-working animation system for player arms & drones (wasted a good amount of time for this just to accomplish nothing; lack of time)
- Complex AI with shooting enemies (lack of time)
- Upgrades & different types of weapons (lack of time)
- Well-made graphics (the things I downloaded are pretty good by themself, but I really didn't try to make the colors match each other)
- Background music (mostly because sndPlaySound can play only one sound asynchronically at the time and using audio system that is in unity would leave no reason to use - WinAPI... which was a core requirement for the project)

This project has a bunch of unsolved issues. Those are:

- Messy directory management (lack of time)
- Lots of unnecessary packages (lack of time (and fear that I would delete something important))
- High disk space usage (reasons unknown? Might be because of the tons of assets I got)
P.s. I HIGHLY do not recommend you to try this game until I fix at least half of the mentioned problems. This project was my first try to do a VR game in Unity all by myself. Never worked with 3D-related stuff in Unity before, so this was quite an interesting experience! Hope to make more of this stuff in future c: P.p.s. All the music is royalty-free, all the sound effects were taken from freesound.org
